# Notes for TI2716-C Multimedia Analysis

These are my review notes for Multimedia Analysis. The topics in these notes (roughly) correspond to those covered in lectures, (roughly) in the same order.

The list below links to each "chapter" of the notes, specifies the lectures covered (3.1T = lecture from the Tuesday of academic week 3.1), and briefly describes the contents of the chapter.

1. [Introduction](introduction.md) (3.1T, 3.1F): Defines **multimedia**, **multimedia analysis**, and **machine learning**, and introduces **information retrieval and filtering** and the various **types of tasks in MMA and ML**.
1. [Background Knowledge](background.md) (3.1T, 3.1F): Reviews **mean**, **variance**, **gaussian functions**, and several **similarity and distance measures**.
1. [Recommender Systems](recommender-systems.md) (3.1T, 3.1F): Introduces **recommender systems**, their **typical tasks**, and their implementation through **challenges**, the **user-item matrix**, **baseline predictions**, and **collaborative filtering**.
1. [Music Information Retrieval](music-information-retrieval.md) (3.2T - guest lecture): Introduces **information retrieval** through the lens of music, and looks at audio music processing (**spectrograms** and **music fundamentals**) as well as some case studies (**fingerprinting**, **cover song retrieval** and **genre identification**).

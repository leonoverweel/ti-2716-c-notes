# Notes for TI2716-C Multimedia Analysis

These are my review notes for Multimedia Analysis. The topics in these notes (roughly) correspond to those covered in lectures, (roughly) in the same order.

The list below links to each "chapter" of the notes, specifies the lectures covered (3.1T = lecture from the Tuesday of academic week 3.1), and briefly describes the contents of the chapter.

1. [Introduction](introduction.md) (3.1T, 3.1F): Defines **multimedia**, **multimedia analysis**, and **machine learning**, and introduces **information retrieval and filtering** and the various **types of tasks in MMA and ML**.
1. [Background Knowledge](background.md) (3.1T, 3.1F): Reviews **mean**, **variance**, **gaussian functions**, image processing concepts such as **SIFT**, and several **similarity and distance measures**.
1. [Evaluating Multimedia Systems](evaluation.md) (3.2F, 3.3F): Covers **evaluating supervised MMA tasks** using **hold out evaluation** and **cross-validation**, **evaluating information retrieval systems**, and several evaluation metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision** and **recall**.
1. [Information Retrieval (IR)](information-retrieval.md) (3.3T): Introduces **information retrieval**.
    1. [IR Using the Vector Space Model](vector-space-model.md) (3.3T): Discusses the **term-document matrix** and the **vector space model** and its optimizations, such as **log frequencies** and **tf-idf weighting**.
    1. [IR Using the Unigram Language Model](unigram-language-model.md) (3.3F): Discusses **language models** and the **unigram language model**.
    1. [Multimedia Information Retrieval](multimedia-information-retrieval.md) (3.3T): Explores **multimedia information retrieval**, specifically **texture recognition** and **bag of features**.
    1. [Music Information Retrieval](music-information-retrieval.md) (3.2T - guest lecture): Examines IR in music, through audio music processing (**spectrograms** and **music fundamentals**) and some case studies (**fingerprinting**, **cover song retrieval** and **genre identification**).
1. [Recommender Systems](recommender-systems.md) (3.1T, 3.1F): Introduces **recommender systems**, their **typical tasks**, and their implementation through **challenges**, the **user-item matrix**, **baseline predictions**, and **collaborative filtering**.
